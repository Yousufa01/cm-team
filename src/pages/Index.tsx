I've learnt so much from your patience, your insane people skills, and the way you get things done without ever losing your cool. May the traffic gods be kind to you on your new Whitefield commute. And yes, this one's been QC'd by you in spirit (as always)... Tallest roast in the room ðŸ¦’."

I still remember you weren't exactly thrilled when a guy got recruited into the team, guess I changed your mind ðŸ˜„. The way you tackle work with speed and precision is something I seriously want to steal. Our go-kart battle is still pending. Let's see who really drives better, without a revive this time."

Also, already missing our Winning Streak rivalry, even though I spent most rounds just trying to catch up ðŸ˜„."

From our legendary nun dance to your Malayalam crash courses, it's been chaos in the best way. Thank you for always being the one who heard out my rants and stress rambles without flinching. Hopefully this time you'll not \"BE ABLE\" to break any bones. I'll miss my volunteer partner and the mad artist that you are."

Your curiosity to learn across different domains and your dedication is something I'll always carry forward. I've definitely learnt how to be more curious and consistent from you."
